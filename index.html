   <!--ABOUT ME SECTION -->
   <h2  id ="mecoding">About Me... And My Coding Experiences</h2>
     <p>My name is Kaelan McPherson, and I am currently in grade 12. My first experience with coding was a year previous, in a grade 11 ICS3U class. In that class, I learned C++, a program generally applied in the field of engineering and science, as well as a few games such as Counter Strike: Global Offensive, also known simply as CSGO. Through this program I learned the application of simple computer science concepts, such as loops, variables, and functions.
     <br>  <br> 
     <img id = "abmeimage" src="https://i.imgur.com/JKNRMcJ.jpg" alt="failed to load image"> 
     This was my first introduction to such things, and established fundamentals that I carried over into my current grade 12 ICS4U class. Prior to the start of my final highschool year I spent months studying further C++ over the final semester of grade 11 and the summer. I bought several books and signed up for some programs to further my knowledge of the field. It was then that I first explored concepts such as Object Oriented Programming, and the more advanced principles that accompany it, such as objects, classes, and several types of functions. After the summer ended, I decided that computer science was one of my passions, and allowed me to freely create, limited only by my knowledge and imagination. After I entered my ICS4U computer science class, I was faced with a huge shift in learning, steering away from C++ and focusing on a more practical application of computer science in response to my ambitions of becoming a part-time web developer, which I discuss later on. Over the next two months I have began to find how useful knowledge of HTML, javascript, jquery, and even SQL can be to build my personal repository of skills.</p>
   
   
    <!-- TEXT AND DESCRIPTIONS FOR MY KHAN ACADEMY MODULES-->
    <br> <br>
    <h2 id = "title">Khan Academy Modules:</h2>
    <img id = "codinggif" src = "https://media1.giphy.com/media/mnpfbcSJ59wRYBD1El/giphy.gif">
    
    
   <h2 id = "location1" class = "moduletitle">Module One: Intro to JS</h2>
   <p>This is the first module I finished on Khan Academy. It introduced the basics of Javascript, and displayed to me the major concepts behind the computer language. In a sense, it developed a framework for my upcoming modules, as I have previously only dabbled in C++, which is a fairly different language, in relation to Javascript. </p>
   <img class = "portimage" src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/zpAIIsDT6piuEIkW8r/giphy.gif">
   
   <h2 id = "location2" class = "moduletitle">Module Two: Programming</h2>
   <p>This is the second module that I completed on Khan Academy. I rushed to complete this because the prior module, intro to JS was ridden with plug-ins, and libraries that didn't properly convey how Javascript would look like in a real world application. So I did this module right away to see how Javascript really looks.</p>
   <img class = "portimage" src = "https://i.imgur.com/sTbWLy6.png">
   
   <h2 id = "location3" class = "moduletitle">Module Three: Digital Information & Algorithms</h2>
   <p>After completion of the programming module I decided that I required more fundamental knowledge that would support me through learning advanced concepts. I turned to this module, and the next one which I will discuss after. This module challenged me to review the fundamentals of not just programming, but computer processes themselves.</p>
   <img class = portimage src = "https://i.imgur.com/wCKYWd7.png">
   
   <h2 id = "location4" class = "moduletitle">Module Four: Data Analysis, Simulations & Security</h2>
    <p>Continuing my exploration of fundamental computer science concepts, I delved into this module, which explored concepts very relevant to my future goals of becoming a skilled web developer. All three modules develop knowledge that can assist in detecting a programs weak points, and how to strengthen them.</p>
    <img class = "portimage" src = "https://i.imgur.com/g1enL8g.png">
    
    <h2 id = location5 class = "moduletitle"> Module Five: Intro to SQL</h2>
    <p>This was the fifth module that I completed on khan academy. It was a huge turnaround from my past coding experiences - teaching a database retrieval method, in the form of a query language. Previously I learned scripting languages that dealt with the creation of programs.  SQL was my first experience with a language that has the purpose of altering and interacting with programs, rather than creating them</p>
    <img class = "portimage" src = "https://i.imgur.com/NKVEUkp.png">
    
     <h2 id = "location6" class = "moduletitle">Module Six: Intro To HTML/CSS</h2>
    <p>This is by far my favorite module that I completed on Khan Academy. It explored the basics of the languages HTML and CSS, enabling me to create a passable website at this point. Throughout the creation of this website I frequently referenced old lessons to refresh some techniques demonstrated.</p>
    <img class = "portimage" src = "https://i.imgur.com/GAt8NoG.png">
    
    
    <h2 id = "location7" class = "moduletitle">Module Seven: HTML/JS Making Webpages Interactive</h2>
    <p>The seventh module that I completed was an eye opener. Up to this point I had a burning question in mind, wondering how the two languages that I have learned, HTML and Javascript, tie together. I knew that they both work together to make webpages interactive, but I never knew <i>specifically</i> how they function together. This module answered all of my questions and introduced fundamental concepts.</p>
    <img class = "portimage" src = "https://cdn.kapwing.com/final_601086f8cd07f400e0ff32da_175730.gif">
    
    <h2 id = "location8" class = "moduletitle">Module Eight: JQUERY</h2>
    <p>This module was also a new experience for me, as it isn't a traditional language, rather it is an offshoot of javascript. This was not one of my favorites, and it got a bit tedious at times, considering no new concepts were introduced through the entire course. However, I can see how JQUERY can be extremely useful, and I have created a google doc filled with notes so I dont forget all I have learned.</p>
    <img class = "portimage" src = "https://i.imgur.com/A4zLtvs.png">

    <h2 id = "location9" class = "moduletitle">Module Nine: Avanced JS - Games and Visualizations </h2>
    <p>This is the first module that pushed me to a level of difficulty that required intensive critical thinking and planning. It was extremely helpful when I was creating my Dan Shiffman project, which is discussed later on. This module displayed to me a practical side of Javascript beyond web-development, and sshowed me the possibilities of coding with this language.</p>
    <img class = "portimage" src = "https://i.imgur.com/eYSnhR5.png">
    
    <h2 id = "location10" class = "moduletitle">Module Ten: Advanced JS Natural Simulations</h2>
    <p>This is the last module that I completed. It completed my current understanding of Javascript, building upon everything else I have learned up to this point. I plan on returning and repeating this module later in time, so I can engrain every detail into my memory.</p>

  <p>
   This is a project that I experimented with and altered over a period of a month. I began by watching the video that constructed the original concept, by Dan Shiffman. The concept revolves around a pinpoint location representing gravity, simulating attraction. In the original program there were several particles floating around with an inital velocity of 0. An attractor is then placed by a mouse click and begins attracting particles. In my refactoring I altered the program to be a more visual program. It begins with many more particles, contain a gamma value of 15, rather than the default 255. Additionally, rather than particles being placed by the user, they are placed by the program through a random function. The particles begin with a slight acceleration, and all the user has to do is change the attraction force. It is a more visual program.

  <h2 id = "title3">My Future With Programming</h2>
  <img class = "portimage" src = "https://media2.giphy.com/media/wjED3QC2or0bgByyKy/giphy.gif">
  <p>Programming has been a passion of mine ever since I started. It has become clear to me that I greatyl enjoy creating things, and programming is a perfect outlet for that. Ever since my first programming computer science class in high school I have actively been increasing my computer science skills, and I now boast partial fluency in 4-5 computer langauges. Additionally, I do not plan on letting go of these skills any time soon. It is my asperation to have 'side hustle' of sorts in the form of web development. There are many websites where you can offer your services to others in need - without the requirement of a degree or any certification. To be well respected and relied on in those communities is my current goal. Once I attain this I will set my sights on something bigger and more difficult. <br> <br>My resolution to this fact was greatly increased during the creation of this website. I stuck true to myself, and did not use any template or copy-paste methods, challenging myself as hard as I could. Simultaneously I enjoyed myself the whole time. For that reason, I believe this field is right for me.</p>
