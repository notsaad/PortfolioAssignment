   <!--ABOUT ME SECTION -->
   <br> <br>
   <h2 id = "title">About Me Section:</h2>
   <p>My name is Saad Mazhar, and this was my second real experience with coding inside of the classroom.
      Coming into this class I would say that I had a medium understanding of JavaScript and small understanding of HTML.
      My biggest goal for this class was to further my understanding of HTML and CSS.
   </p>


    <!-- TEXT AND DESCRIPTIONS FOR MANDATORY MODULES-->
    <br> <br>
    <h2 id = "title">Mandatory Modules:</h2>


   <h2 id = "location1" class = "moduletitle">Module One: Intro to JS</h2>
   <p>This was the very first module I ever did on Khan Academy and it was my first ever experience with coding. I found it very fun and instanstly fell in love with coding.

   </p>
   <img class = "portimage" src = "https://i.imgur.com/4uepd7a.png">

   <h2 id = "location2" class = "moduletitle">Module Two: Intro To HTML/CSS</h2>
   <p>This was the second module that I completed and it laid out the basics of webpages and what goes into designing them.
      This module was very good for laying down the foundation of HTML and CSS for me. Additionally, these basics were essential for a ton of things including this website.</p>
   <img class = "portimage" src = "https://i.imgur.com/KiWRGvl.png">

   <h2 id = "location3" class = "moduletitle">Module Three: Computer Science Principles: Programming</h2>
   <p>This is the first module I did that was on the AP Computer Science Principles Section. This was a new style of learning for me but I personally also enjoyed the quiz centered learning style.
   I also think I'm going to revisit this after the course to hone up on my skills.</p>
   <img class = "portimage" src = "https://i.imgur.com/URpdy6A.png">

   <h2 id = "location4" class = "moduletitle">Module Four:  Advanced JS - Games and Visualizations</h2>
    <p>This module was one of my personal favourites because it started first involving games with the code, and it truly captured my attention.
      I think this was a really important module for  me to learn because it really helped me with the agario coding challenge.
    </p>
    <img class = "portimage" src = "https://i.imgur.com/q063mP0.png">

    <h2 id = location5 class = "moduletitle">Module Five:  Advanced JS - Natural Simulations</h2>
    <p>This module was also very interesting because it started adding animation, and connecting your code to real word things such as water flowing in a river.
       I also found this module to be one of the more difficult in terms of coding, however it was a welcome challenge.
       The module will also be essential for the future because it lays the foundation for more complicated game mechanics.
    </p>

    <!--OTHER MODULES -->
    <h2 id = "title2">Other Modules</h2>
   <p><b>
    1. Intro to SQL </b>
    <br>
    This was the first non-mandatory module that I completed, and I found it pretty interesting. This module was also completely different to what I was used to because it was more practical
    and I was used to more game focused coding. I think it was good to learn this though because it could be very useful to know lots of languages in the future.
    <br>
    <img class = "portimage" src = "https://i.imgflip.com/559yra.gif">
   <br><b>
    2. HTML/JS: Making webpages interactive </b>
    <br>
     This was the second non-mandatory module that I completed, and I would say that it was my personal favourite actually.
     I say this because I found the animations to be very interesting to learn and to be much more visually appealing.
     This skill was definitely a really good one to have because it's so widely used and it has so many applications.
     <br>
     <img class = "portimage" src = "https://i.imgflip.com/559zgd.gif">
     <br><b>
    3. jQuery </b> <br>
    This was one of the simpler modules in my opinion. I say this because a lot of the fundamentals were the same as the previous module, with simple but important additives.
    I think this module was also important because knowledge of jQuery is essential to be proficient in HTML and CSS.
    <br>
    <img class = "portimage" src = "https://i.imgflip.com/55a32z.gif">
   <br><b>
    4. Dan Shiffman's Agar.io </b> <br>
    This was my favourite assignment in the whole year. I say this because I love making games and being able to code a game and also being to modify and add to it as I please was really enjoyable.
    It also taught me a lot and will be a good reference point for later coding  projects.
    <br>
      <img class = "portimage" src = "https://i.imgflip.com/55a2bm.gif">
   <br><b>
    5. Algorithms and Simulations </b> <br>
    This was the last module that I completed, and it was another one of the AP Computer Science courses. As I previously said this type of module was different because it was much less hands on
    and more quiz and knowledge based, however I didn't mind it and I think it's important to try different types of learning.

  <!--TAKEAWAYS FROM THIS CLASS & MY FUTURE WITH PROGRAMMING-->
   <br> <br>
  <h2 id = "title3">Takeaways From This Class & My Future With Programming</h2>
      My first takeaway from this class was how vast coding is and how much can truly be done with it. The options truly are limitless and this class just opened my eyes up to that.
      Additionally, I also learned that I want to keep furthering my education in Computer Science and I applied for the CS program at four different universities.
      (Ended up getting accepted to uOttawa for Honors Computer Science!).
      Lastly, I want to thank you for the great course and for making the best of the odd circumstances and I am also very excited to keep learning Programming!.
